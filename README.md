**Overview**

Comprehensive design of an AI Tutoring Agent that differs from a generic LLM-based system by incorporating course-specific pedagogy, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with FAISS, and an end-to-end “classroom” pipeline (including planning, learning, and assessment). The design is broken into four main sections:

1. **Proposed Tech Stack**
2. **Literature Review & Related Work**
3. **High-Level System Architecture**
4. **Detailed Implementation Steps & Module Descriptions**

Each section discusses how we satisfy the requirements: domain-aware tutoring (grade-level or discipline-specific), document ingestion & RAG via FAISS, timetable planning, interactive homework/assessment, and a FastAPI backend powering a UI-driven web application.

## 2. Literature Review & Related Work

1. **Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)**

   * Anderson et al. introduced the “Cognitive Tutor” paradigm, which leverages student modeling, problem-solving steps, and tailored feedback \[1]. It emphasizes knowledge tracing and step-by-step skill mastery.
   * Graesser et al. developed AutoTutor, an ITS that engages students in a conversational, Socratic dialogue—parsing student inputs and scaffolding knowledge \[2].
   * Murray summarizes ITS architectures, typically containing a domain model (what to teach), a student model (what the student knows), and a pedagogical module (how to teach) \[3].
     These classical ITS frameworks highlight the need for (a) content representation aligned with curriculum objectives, (b) a student model tracking mastery, and (c) adaptive feedback. Our system will follow this tri-tiered ITS architecture but replace domain-specific rule engines with RAG (retrieval + LLM) to dynamically generate pedagogy aligned to user-provided curricula.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

   * Lewis et al. introduced RAG architectures where an external dense retriever (e.g., FAISS) retrieves relevant document chunks, and a generative LLM synthesizes answers conditioned on retrieved passages \[4].
   * Izacard and Grave proposed leveraging cross-encoder rerankers and bi-encoder retrievers jointly to improve RAG quality, emphasizing iterative retrieval and generation loops \[5].
   * Ahmed et al. applied RAG for educational Q\&A over domain textbooks, showing that retrieving exact curriculum passages before generation yields more pedagogically aligned responses \[6].
     These works guide our choice of FAISS + SBERT as a dense retriever, feeding retrieved chunks into GPT-4 (or equivalent) with structured prompts that align to grade-level methodologies.

3. **Document Chunking & Embeddings**

   * Reimers and Gurevych demonstrate that Sentence-BERT embeddings (producing 384- to 768-dim vectors) outperform average BERT embeddings for semantic similarity \[7].
   * Patil et al. highlight the importance of document chunking at logical section boundaries (e.g., subheadings in a textbook) so that RAG retrieval is precise \[8].
     We will use PyPDF2/pdfminer to extract headings & chunks, embed each chunk via SBERT, and store them in FAISS, indexing by `<course_id, chapter_id, chunk_id>`.

4. **Curriculum Mapping & Timetable Generation**

   * Kumar et al. propose using ontologies to represent learning objectives (LOs) and to sequence topics based on prerequisite graphs \[9].
   * Brusilovsky and Pesin describe how adaptive sequencing algorithms can propose a study plan given a desired completion date and per-week commitment \[10].
     Our system will parse the table of contents (TOC) of a provided PDF to extract topics (via spaCy pattern matching on headings), construct a linear prerequisite chain (i.e., chapter 1 → chapter 2 → …), and then solve a simple scheduling optimization (topic durations assigned across available days) to produce a timetable.

5. **Automated Homework Grading**

   * Shermis and Burstein review automated essay scoring methods, including rubric-based classification and LLM-based evaluation \[11].
   * Piech et al. show how machine learning can grade short math assignments by comparing student solutions to canonical solutions, identifying step errors \[12].
     We will implement a hybrid approach: for short answer/math problems, retrieve relevant examples (RAG) and use GPT-4 to produce a model solution plus grading rubric; then compare student submission (a free-text answer or scanned handwritten solution converted via OCR) against the rubric to assign a pass/fail or percentage.

```

1. **Frontend UI (React + Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)**

   * **Initial Page / Onboarding**:

     * Collect user’s role (student vs. tutor), grade level or discipline (e.g., Grade 6 math, BA course).
     * Ask for course name, “which textbook(s) will you use?”, and optional upload of syllabus or PDF.
   * **Classroom Dashboard**:

     * Tabs for “Learning”, “Timetable”, “Homework”.
     * Visual summary: current week, next homework due, upcoming topics.
   * **Learning Page**:

     * Embedded “Lesson Viewer” to display relevant PDF snippet or “explanation widget” (LLM-driven explanation aligned to curriculum).
     * Navigation: Previous topic / Next topic.
   * **Timetable Page**:

     * UI form: “Select start date, end date, # days/week, hours/day.”
     * Visual calendar (e.g., react-big-calendar) showing assigned topics.
   * **Homework Page**:

     * List of assignments (per day).
     * Upload area: student submits answer (text input, file upload, or scanned image).
     * Grading status: “pending / graded / needs revision.”
   * **Profile / Settings**:

     * User can update personal details, preferred learning style (e.g., “explain step-by-step vs. conceptual summary”), time zone (default Australia/Melbourne), push-notification preferences.

2. **Backend (FastAPI + Celery + RAG orchestration)**

   * **Authentication**: OAuth2 + JWT. Endpoints for login/signup/tutor invites.
   * **Document Ingestion & Indexing**:

     * Endpoint: `POST /api/documents/upload` (accept PDF, DOCX, EPUB).
     * Celery Task: parse PDF → extract TOC (chapters, sections) → chunk into \~300–500 word passages (preserving section headings).
     * For each chunk: generate SBERT embedding → insert into FAISS index (locally or via MongoDB’s vector store).
     * Store metadata: `{doc_id, chapter_title, chunk_id, page_numbers, embedding_vector}`.
   * **Online Document Lookup**:

     * Endpoint: `GET /api/documents/search?query=<string>`
     * First search relational DB for known textbooks (exact file name or ISBN) → if found, return download URL (if user has permission).
     * If not found: query configured external repositories (e.g., open educational resources API) → if available, ingest and index on-the-fly or return “not found.”
   * **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:

     * Endpoint: `POST /api/rag/query` with payload `{user_id, doc_id, query_text, max_chunks, …}`
     * 1. Retrieve top k relevant chunks from FAISS for `query_text` → return chunk texts + metadata.
     * 2. Assemble prompt:

       ```
       You are a Grade 6 Math Tutor. Use only the curriculum defined in the attached chunks (shown below). Provide a step-by-step solution aligned with Textbook A’s methodology. 
       [Insert retrieved chunk texts here]
       Student Question: <query_text>
       Provide:
       1) Explanation using terminology from these chunks.
       2) Low-complexity worked example if applicable.
       ```
     * 3. Send to GPT-4 (via API) → return response.
     * 4. Log retrieval IDs + timestamp + student\_id for analytics.
   * **Planner / Timetable Generation**:

     * Endpoint: `POST /api/planner/create` with `{user_id, doc_id, desired_completion_date, days_per_week}`
     * Steps (synchronous or via Celery):

       1. Extract TOC from previously parsed metadata (list of chapters/sections in reading order).
       2. Assign estimated “hours required per chapter” (could be defaulted via page count or pre-annotated by tutor).
       3. Solve a greedy schedule: starting from current date, for each selected study day, assign next chapter until hours are exhausted.
       4. Data model:

          ```
          Table: schedule_slots
          ┌─────────────┬───────────┬─────────────────────┐
          │ schedule_id │ date      │ chapter_id         │
          ├─────────────┼───────────┼─────────────────────┤
          │     42      │2025-06-10 │ “Chapter 3: Fractions”│
          └─────────────┴───────────┴─────────────────────┘
          ```
       5. Return JSON: `{ schedule_id, slots: [ { date, chapter_title }, … ] }`
   * **Learning Progress Tracking (Student Model)**:

     * For each `user_id` + `chapter_id`, track `status ∈ {not_started, in_progress, completed}`.
     * Track timestamps, quiz scores (optional micro-quizzes per chapter).
     * Purpose: to ensure the “Homework” module only appears when `status == “completed”` or based on tutor settings.
   * **Homework / Assignment Module**:

     * Endpoint: `POST /api/homework/submit` with `{user_id, schedule_id, chapter_id, submission_data}`

       * `submission_data` can be:

         * free-text answer (for short answer or essay)
         * structured JSON (e.g., math problem: list of steps in LaTeX or plaintext)
         * file upload (student can upload scanned handwritten math, which is OCR’d via Tesseract + Mathpix, returning LaTeX)
     * Celery Task:

       1. **Generate Model Answer & Rubric**:

          * RAG query: retrieve relevant chunk(s) for `chapter_id` (e.g., in a Grade 6 textbook, “Ex 3.1: Word Problems”), feed into GPT-4 with a prompt like:

            ```
            Using the following textbook excerpts, produce:
            a) A model solution (step-by-step) to the sample homework in Chapter 3.
            b) A rubric with point allocation for each step.
            ```
          * Store model answer + rubric.
       2. **Grade Student Submission**:

          * Compare student’s answer (converted to plaintext or LaTeX) to the rubric: for each rubric item, ask GPT-4 to judge “Correct / Partially Correct / Incorrect” given student’s steps.

            ```
            For each rubric line below, determine if the student’s answer step matches. Return a JSON with: 
            { step_id: “correct” | “partial” | “incorrect” }.
            [Insert rubric items]
            [Insert student submission]
            ```
          * Compute a percentage score; if ≥ 50%, mark as “passed.”
       3. **Feedback Loop**:

          * If passed:

            * Update `student_model[chapter_id] = completed`
            * Notify frontend → prompt “Congratulations, you passed! Proceed to next chapter or revisit this one?”
          * If not passed:

            * Return detailed feedback (e.g., “You missed the subtraction step in line 2. Refer to page 45 in the textbook”).
            * Allow student to resubmit.
   * **Classroom Session Workflow**

     1. **Onboarding** → collect syllabus / PDF(s).
     2. **Parse & Index Documents** (Celery).
     3. **Prompt Student to Schedule** → call `/api/planner/create` → return timetable.
     4. **Daily Session**: Frontend shows “Today’s Topic = Chapter X.”

        * Student clicks “Learn” → UI loads RAG viewer for that chapter.
        * After reading, student clicks “Mark as Completed” (Backend flips status).
        * Then “Begin Homework” → upload / answer.
        * Grading pipeline runs in background; results are shown.
        * Upon passing, UI shows “Next Session = Chapter X+1.”

3. **Storage Layer**

   * **MongoDB**

     * Collections:

       1. `documents` → `{ _id, user_id, title, uploaded_at, toc_structure, status }`
       2. `document_chunks` → `{ _id, document_id, chapter_id, chunk_id, page_range, text, embedding }`
       3. `faiss_index_meta` → metadata linking chunk IDs to FAISS vectors
   * **PostgreSQL / MySQL**

     * Tables:

       1. `users` → `{ user_id, name, email, role, hashed_password, preferences }`
       2. `classrooms` → `{ classroom_id, tutor_id, title, subject, grade_level, created_at }`
       3. `enrollments` → `{ user_id, classroom_id, joined_at }`
       4. `schedule_slots` → `{ slot_id, classroom_id, date, chapter_id, status }`
       5. `homework_submissions` → `{ submission_id, user_id, slot_id, chapter_id, submitted_at, grade, feedback }`
       6. `student_model` → `{ user_id, chapter_id, status, attempts, last_attempt_at }`

## 4. Detailed Implementation Steps & Module Descriptions

### 4.1 Onboarding & Classroom Initialization

1. **Landing Page & Information Gathering**

   * **UI (React/Next.js)**: Display a form that collects:

     1. Classroom name
     2. Tutor (or student) role; if tutor, ability to invite students via email.
     3. Subject & Grade Level (e.g., “Grade 6 Math” or “BA Course: Business Analysis 101”).
     4. Upload “Primary Textbook PDF” (optional; can add later).
     5. (Optional) Upload “Syllabus” as PDF or JSON (outline of week-by-week topics).
   * **API**: `POST /api/classrooms/create`

     * Validates user roles (tutor vs. student).
     * Stores a `classroom` record in relational DB.
     * If a PDF is uploaded: store raw file to S3 and trigger Celery task `parse_document(document_id)`.

2. **Document Parsing & Indexing**

   * **Celery Worker** (`tasks.py`) → `def parse_document(document_id):`

     1. Retrieve raw PDF from S3.
     2. Use PyPDF2 / pdfminer to extract text and headings.

        * Strategy:

          * Run `pdfminer.six` to extract text, capturing heading levels by font size or explicit TOC metadata (if the PDF has an embedded TOC).
          * If no explicit TOC, apply a heuristic: detect lines with larger font or “Chapter X” regex.
     3. Build a tree structure:

        ```python
        toc = [
          {
            "chapter_id": "ch1",
            "title": "Chapter 1: Whole Numbers",
            "subsections": [
              { "section_id": "ch1_sec1", "title": "1.1 Counting Strategies" },
              ...
            ]
          },
          ...
        ]
        ```
     4. For each leaf node (e.g., `ch1_sec1`):

        * Extract the associated pages (or nearest page span) as full text.
        * Split into \~300-word chunks along sentence boundaries (using spaCy’s sentencizer).
        * Each chunk record:

          ```json
          {
            "document_id": "...",
            "chapter_id": "ch1",
            "chunk_id": "ch1_sec1_chunk_01",
            "page_start": 2,
            "page_end": 3,
            "text": "Text of this chunk…"
          }
          ```
     5. **Embedding Generation**:

        * Batch process chunk texts through SBERT (e.g., `all-mpnet-base-v2`) to get 768-dim dense vectors.
        * Insert vectors into FAISS index (IVFFlat or HNSW index, depending on scale).
        * Store chunk-level metadata in MongoDB’s `document_chunks` collection, including embedding vector (for reference) and FAISS pointer (index ID).
     6. Update `documents` collection: add `status="indexed"`, store `toc_structure`.

   * **Result**:

     * All chunks of textbook are indexed in FAISS, each with a vector and metadata pointing back to chapter/subsection.

### 4.2 Online Document Lookup

1. **“Search for Textbook” Endpoint**

   * **API**: `GET /api/documents/find?query=<string>`
   * Process:

     1. Search local `documents` collection by `title` or `ISBN` (exact or fuzzy match).
     2. If found: return `{ found: true, doc_id, download_url }`.
     3. If not found: optionally query an external OER API (e.g., OpenStax catalog) or a configured file repository (if institution-provided).
     4. If external result found: present a download link. Upon user clicking “import,” repeat ingestion pipeline.
     5. Else: return `{ found: false, message: "Document not available." }`.

### 4.3 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Module

1. **FAISS Index Structure**

   * **Index Type**: Start with FAISS HNSW for moderate size (< 100K chunks).
   * **Embedding Dim**: 768 (SBERT).
   * **Metadata**: *Not stored directly in FAISS*, but we keep a parallel mapping in MongoDB from FAISS vector ID → `{document_id, chapter_id, chunk_id, page_range, text_excerpt}`.

2. **Retrieval Logic**

   * **Step 1**: Receive student query (e.g., “Solve: 4 × 25 + 3”).
   * **Step 2**: Preprocess query:

     * Lowercase, remove punctuation (unless mathematical symbols).
     * Optionally detect question type via simple regex (e.g., “Solve” → math problem vs. “Explain” → conceptual).
   * **Step 3**: Generate SBERT embedding of query (same model as chunk embeddings).
   * **Step 4**: Query FAISS for top k (e.g., k = 5) nearest neighbors (using inner product or cosine).
   * **Step 5**: Fetch metadata for each neighbor (MongoDB): gather text snippets (300 words each).
   * **Step 6**: Construct “context” string by concatenating:

     ```
     [Chunk 1: Chapter 2 – Multiplication Techniques (pages 34–35)]
     <text of chunk 1>

     [Chunk 2: Chapter 4 – Order of Operations (pages 56–57)]
     <text of chunk 2>
     ...
     ```
   * **Step 7**: Prompt Template (for Grade 6 Math):

     ```
     You are a Grade 6 Math Tutor. Use only the provided textbook excerpts to:
     1. Identify the appropriate method (e.g., long multiplication, distributive property).
     2. Solve the student’s problem step-by-step, using the same notation as in the textbook.
     3. Include intermediate steps (no leaps).
     Context:
     <insert retrieved contexts>

     Student Question: "<student_query>"

     Provide your answer below:
     ```
   * **Step 8**: Send to GPT-4 via OpenAI API → receive completion → return as JSON:

     ```json
     {
       "answer_text": "...",
       "used_chunk_ids": ["ch2_chunk12", "ch4_chunk05"],
       "llm_tokens_used": 432
     }
     ```
   * **Step 9**: Log (in Postgres or a logging DB): `{user_id, timestamp, query_text, used_chunk_ids, response_id}`.

3. **Customization by Grade / Discipline**

   * On onboarding, we store `classroom.level = "grade_6_math"` or `= "ba_business_analysis"`.
   * Each level has a “pedagogical profile” text block (e.g., for grade 6: use concrete numbers, visuals, simple language; for BA: use business-case examples, high-level analysis).
   * The prompt template is parameterized by `pedagogical_profile`.
   * Example BA prompt:

     ```
     You are a business analysis tutor for undergraduates. Use the provided chapter excerpts to answer the following:
     1. Identify the problem context based on the syllabus.
     2. Provide a step-by-step business analysis approach (e.g., SWOT, PESTEL) aligned to the textbook methodology.
     3. Use discipline-specific terminology from the provided excerpts.
     Student Question: "<query_text>"
     ```

### 4.4 Planner & Timetable Generation Pipeline

1. **Extracting Structured Topics / Prerequisite Graph**

   * The ingestion task already extracted `toc_structure`: a list of chapters/sections in canonical order.
   * We assign an estimated “effort\_hours” per chapter. By default:

     ```python
     effort_hours = pages_in_chapter * 0.5  # e.g., 30 pages → 15 hours
     ```
   * Alternatively, tutors can edit these estimates via an admin UI (e.g., “Chapter 3 takes 5 hours because it’s short”).

2. **User Input for Scheduling**

   * Frontend “Timetable” form asks:

     * Start date (default = today, e.g., “2025-06-10”).
     * Desired finish date (e.g., “2025-07-31”).
     * Days per week they wish to study (e.g., “3 days/week”).
     * Approximate hours per session (e.g., “1 hour/day”).
   * Compute total available sessions = (# of weeks) × (days\_per\_week).
   * Total available hours = sessions × hours\_per\_session.
   * Verify total effort ≤ total available hours. If not, show warning: “You need at least X weeks; do you want to increase days/week?”

3. **Simple Scheduling Algorithm**

   * Let `topics = [ (chapter_id, effort_hours), … ]` in curricular order.
   * Let `session_capacity = hours_per_session`.
   * Initialize `current_date = start_date`.
   * Loop over `timeslots = generate_dates(start_date, finish_date, days_per_week)` (e.g., \[2025-06-10, 2025-06-12, 2025-06-14, 2025-06-17, …]).
   * For each `timeslot`:

     * While `session_capacity_remaining = session_capacity`:

       1. If `topics[0].effort_hours_remaining ≤ session_capacity_remaining`:

          * Assign entire chapter\_id to this timeslot; subtract `effort_hours_remaining` from `session_capacity_remaining`; pop chapter.
       2. Else:

          * Assign a “partial” (chapter\_id, session\_capacity\_remaining) to this timeslot; decrement `topics[0].effort_hours_remaining` by `session_capacity_remaining`; set `session_capacity_remaining = 0`; keep chapter in front of queue.
     * Save `schedule_slots` entries for that date.
   * Return the constructed list:

     ```json
     [
       { "date": "2025-06-10", "assignments": [ { "chapter_id": "ch1", "hours": 1 } ] },
       { "date": "2025-06-12", "assignments": [ { "chapter_id": "ch2", "hours": 0.6 }, { "chapter_id": "ch3", "hours": 0.4 } ] },
       …
     ]
     ```

4. **Returning & Displaying Timetable**

   * **API**: `POST /api/planner/create` returns `{ schedule_id, slots: […] }`.
   * The frontend (React calendar) renders each slot as a calendar event: “Chapter 1 (1 h)”.
   * Students can click on a day → see “Today’s Topic(s)”.
   * Clicking “Mark Chapter X as Completed” will:

     * Update `student_model` table: `{ user_id, chapter_id, status="completed" }`.
     * If “partial” assignments remain, those appear next time in “Today’s Topic”.

### 4.5 Learning Module (Interactive Lesson Viewer)

1. **Lesson Retrieval**

   * Student clicks “Learn Chapter X” → frontend calls `/api/documents/get_chapter?doc_id=…&chapter_id=chX`.
   * Backend:

     * Fetch all `document_chunks` for `chapter_id=chX` → assemble a flattened PDF viewer or text.
   * Frontend:

     * Use `react-pdf` or embed PDF page images → highlight current chapter pages.
     * Optionally show “RAG Popup”: a floating “Ask a question” widget – when student types a question, send `/api/rag/query` with context limited to `chapter_id=chX` (FAISS retrieval restricted to that chapter), so explanations stay on-topic.

2. **Progress Marking**

   * After reading, student clicks “Mark as Completed” → call `/api/lesson/complete` → backend updates `student_model[chapter_id] = “completed”` → triggers optional “unlock homework” logic.

### 4.6 Homework / Assessment Module

1. **Homework Generation (By Tutor or Automated)**

   * Tutors can define homework items manually (e.g., “Exercise 3.1 #2–5” in PDF).
   * Or, automatically generate sample questions:

     * API: `/api/homework/generate?chapter_id=chX&count=3`
     * Backend runs RAG:

       ```
       Prompt: 
       Using the following chapter excerpts (chX), 
       generate 3 homework questions of increasing difficulty that match the curriculum style.
       Provide answers (step by step).
       ```
   * Store generated questions + answers in `homework_items` table.

2. **Student Submission**

   * On “Homework” page, student sees list of pending assignments (linked to `schedule_slots`).
   * For each assignment:

     * Frontend presents questions (text or file references).
     * Student types answers or uploads a file (e.g., image of handwritten solution).
   * Submit → call `/api/homework/submit`.

3. **Automated Grading Pipeline (Celery)**

   * **Step 1: Preprocess Submission**

     * If file upload: run OCR → convert to plaintext/LaTeX.
     * Clean text (remove noise).
   * **Step 2: Retrieve Model Answer & Rubric**

     * If tutor provided static answers: fetch from `homework_items`.
     * Else: generate on the fly:

       ```
       Prompt: 
       Given chapter excerpts (chX), produce a model solution and a rubric for the following question: "<homework_prompt>"
       ```
     * Save `model_answer`, `rubric` (list of criterion).
   * **Step 3: Grade**

     * For each rubric criterion:

       * Prompt:

         ```
         Criterion: "<criterion text>"
         Student’s response: "<student_answer>"
         Does the student’s response fulfill the criterion? Answer “yes” or “no,” and if “no,” briefly explain the discrepancy.
         ```
       * Collect results for all criteria → compute `score = (# criteria passed) / (total criteria) × 100`.
   * **Step 4: Update Status**

     * If `score ≥ 50`: mark `homework_submissions.status = "passed"`; else `status = "failed"`.
     * Save `feedback` (detailed criterion-level comments).
   * **Step 5: Notify Student (Frontend Polling or WebSocket)**

     * Student’s “Homework” page polls `/api/homework/status?submission_id=…` or uses real-time notifications (Socket.io) to receive graded result.

4. **Feedback Loop & Next Steps**

   * If passed:

     * Frontend: show “You passed with X%. Proceed to next topic?” Button → calls `/api/lesson/complete` for that chapter; unlocks next schedule slot.
   * If failed:

     * Show feedback per criterion (e.g., “Step 2: Forgot to carry the 1 from tens place”).
     * Provide links to relevant chapter sections (FAISS retrieval of page).
     * Option to “Review Lesson” (jump to Lesson Viewer).

---

## 5. Security, Scaling, & Deployment Considerations

1. **Authentication & Authorization**

   * Use FastAPI’s OAuth2PasswordBearer + JWT tokens.
   * Roles:

     * **Tutor**: can create classrooms, upload/ingest documents, generate homework questions manually.
     * **Student**: can enroll in classrooms, follow timetable, submit homework.
   * Secure endpoints with `@router.get("/…", dependencies=[Depends(get_current_active_user), Depends(role_check)])`.

2. **Scaling the RAG Pipeline**

   * **FAISS** index should be memory-mapped on multiple nodes (or shard index by `course_id`).
   * **Embedding** service runs on GPU instance (for high throughput); utilize batching to embed large PDF chunk sets.
   * **LLM calls** (GPT-4) can become expensive: consider local open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama 3) for lower-stakes tasks (e.g., rubric generation).
   * **Celery workers**: autoscale based on queue length (Redis’s backlog).

3. **Data Privacy & Permissions**

   * Each document is tied to a `classroom_id` and only visible to enrolled users.
   * Use signed S3 URLs for PDF downloads with short expiration.
   * Encrypt PII in the database (e.g., students’ performance data).

4. **Analytics & Logging**

   * Track:

     1. Per-chapter completion rates.
     2. Average homework scores.
     3. Frequent RAG queries (for “hot topics” where students struggle).
   * Logs stored in ELK or sent to a logging aggregator.
   * Tutors can view “Class Performance Dashboard” (bar charts: % students passed per chapter).

5. **CI/CD & Infrastructure**

   * **GitHub Actions** pipeline:

     1. Lint & unit tests (pytest).
     2. Build Docker images (frontend, backend).
     3. Push to Container Registry.
     4. Terraform apply to update infrastructure (Kubernetes Deployment, GKE cluster, Cloud SQL).
   * **Kubernetes manifests**:

     * Deploy FastAPI + Uvicorn in a Deployment with 3 replicas; Service with autoscaling.
     * FAISS service as a StatefulSet (persisting index on PVC).
     * Celery worker + Redis deployed as separate pods.
     * Ingress (nginx) to route `/api` to backend, `/` to frontend.

## 6. How This Satisfies All Requirements

1. **Curriculum-Aligned, Grade/Discipline-Specific Tutoring**

   * By ingesting the student’s actual textbook (PDF) and extracting its table of contents, the system ensures all content is aligned with what the student is learning in class.
   * Prompt templates are parameterized by `classroom.level` so that a Grade 6 Math student receives explanations at an appropriate cognitive level (no adult abstractions). A BA student receives business-analysis terminology.

2. **RAG via FAISS for Accurate, Contextual Answers**

   * Instead of a generic, adult-style solution, RAG retrieves curriculum-specific passages → LLM generates answers anchored in those passages.
   * FAISS ensures sub-second similarity search across thousands of chunks.

3. **Planner / Timetable**

   * The automated scheduling algorithm distributes chapters/topics over the requested timeframe, ensuring the student sees “What to study each day.”
   * Students can specify “X days a week, Y hours per day”; the system solves a simple bin-packing of chapter hours into session slots.

4. **Homework / Assessment Workflow**

   * Automated generation of both homework questions (optionally) and grading/rubric via LLM ensures consistency with the textbook methodology.
   * Student submissions (including scanned work) are automatically OCR’d and graded, with criterion-level feedback.
   * Passing thresholds (50%) trigger progression; failure triggers “review” loops.

5. **Backend with FastAPI & Modular Services**

   * All endpoints are RESTful, documented via OpenAPI (Swagger UI).
   * Celery handles long-running tasks (embedding, grading) out of request/response cycle.
   * Relational vs. NoSQL separation gives flexibility: MongoDB for unstructured text & vector metadata; Postgres for structured, relational data.

6. **Extensibility / Future Work**

   * **Multi-Textbook Support**: Add the ability to ingest multiple documents; RAG retrieval can consider all documents, filtered by `chapter_id` or `tag`.
   * **Student Modeling**: Incorporate Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) or Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) to predict mastery probabilities rather than a simple binary “completed/failed.”
   * **Adaptive Content**: If a student struggles on a concept, automatically inject supplementary practice problems (generated via LLM) before moving on.
   * **Peer Collaboration**: Add discussion forums or group assignments; leverage RAG to auto-summarize forum threads or common misconceptions.
   * **Analytics Dashboard**: For tutors, visualize cohort performance, time-spent metrics, and identify “problematic” chapters by low average scores.
